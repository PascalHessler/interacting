Simple Slopes:
 At 15,50th and 85th percentile of what's i the x-axis, what is y-hat for the focal predictor
 
JN
  1) At 15,50th and 85th percentile of what's i the x-axis, what is effect for the focal predictor
  
  2) Range where significantly positive/negative
  

For each line {  
	If there is one region of significance, report the numbers\
	If more than one, say, "more than one region detected, 
		Region 1: min to -4.2: significantly negative
		Region 2: 4.2 to 5.8:  not significant 
		Region 3:  5.8 to max significantly positive	
	}
	
	When moderator is at 50th 
		Region 1: min to -4.2: significantly negative
		Region 2: 4.2 to 5.8:  not significant 
		Region 3:  5.8 to max significantly positive	
	}
	
	
	When moderator is at 85th
