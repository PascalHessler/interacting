- automatize "x" or x work as values for x, so users can enter teh name of the column with or withot quotes
- automatize reducing k, and only showing error if k is not set


max.unique= 20 #maximum number of uniquely identified frequencies

if (nuz<max.unique) treat discrete
		-frequncies of each unique values are displayed
		-fit gam only to those zs, and do type='b'
		
if (nuz>max.unique) treat as continues
		-frequencies for each bin
		-fit gam to 100 points and treat as continuous scale
