Andres:
-Could be useful to (automatically) display "k=#" in figures with GAM for transparency
-at some point, we discussed the idea of automatically generating multiple visualizations with different ks. 
		It might be nice to display and generate k=3, and then generate k=5,k=7, etc automatically so it forces users to look at them.

- I worry that requiring categorical variables with 2 levels to be factors is too restrictive. It basically forces researchers to use dummy coding. 
		But researchers may want to use contrast coding instead (+1,-1 or +.5,-.5) that allows them to interpret other effects in their models as main effects rather than simple effects. 
		8015 exemplifies this: if the key categorical predictor is entered as a factor, the interaction results differ even more from the original results (compared to using 1 or -1, which the authors used),
		 so it's not really possible to model the analysis that is closest to the one used by the authors with interprobe.
