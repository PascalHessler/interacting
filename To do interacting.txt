-either ban or deal with squared terms
-report numbers in the figure to allow checking reproducibility
- include in interprobe output the range of values ofr which the effects are p<.05 pos / neg
possibly a paragraph

Output
Simple Slopes:
 At 15,50th and 85th percentile of what's i the x-axis, what is y-hat for the focal predictor
 
JN
  1) At 15,50th and 85th percentile of what's i the x-axis, what is effect for the focal predictor
  
  2) Range where significantly positive/negative
  

For each line {  
	If there is one region of significance, report the numbers\
	If more than one, say, "more than one region detected, 
		Region 1: min to -4.2: significantly negative
		Region 2: 4.2 to 5.8:  not significant 
		Region 3:  5.8 to max significantly positive	
	}
	
	When moderator is at 50th 
		Region 1: min to -4.2: significantly negative
		Region 2: 4.2 to 5.8:  not significant 
		Region 3:  5.8 to max significantly positive	
	}
	
	
	When moderator is at 85th 
	If more than one, say, "more than one region detected, 
		Region 1: min to -4.2: significantly negative
		Region 2: 4.2 to 5.8:  not significant 
		Region 3:  5.8 to max significantly positive	
	}

Added by Andres after 2024/04/29: 
1a. Allow changing the legend titles (right now-> "Focal Predictor Value" for simple slopes and "Contrasted Focal Predictor" for JN)
1b. Allow changing the legend labels (e.g. 0->"Attitudinal", 1->"Behavioral"). For some reason, recoding the labels to meaningful character labels and refitting the model changes the simple slopes figure (even though I made sure the reference group is correct)
2. Give a bit space between ylab1 text and left end of plot (looks too right right now)
3. Allow single x-axis for both plots (to avoid repetition, given that its identical)
4. If provided model is fitted with lm(), default to: main2="Linear Johnson-Neyman"
5. It would be nice, but not essential, if there was a way to modify the size of the plot to adjust resolution etc.
6. The lines showing where there is more or less data still feel a bit small, see "8011 interprobe figure linear.svg" in RB/Other folder for instance.
7. Could be useful to display "k=#" in figures with GAM for transparency
